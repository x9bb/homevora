                            <p>We retain personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to:</p>

                            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
                                <li>Provide our services;</li>

                            <p>Retention periods vary depending on the nature of the data and our contractual obligations with clients. When information is no longer needed, we may delete it, anonymize it, or securely store it in archived form.</p>

                            <h2 style={{ marginTop: '32px', marginBottom: '16px', fontSize: '24px' }}>9. Data Security</h2>

                            <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information, including:</p>

                            <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '16px' }}>
                                <li>Encryption in transit for sensitive data where appropriate;</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any passwords or account credentials and for limiting access to your devices.</p>

                            <h2 style={{ marginTop: '32px', marginBottom: '16px', fontSize: '24px' }}>10. Children's Privacy</h2>

                            <p>Our services are designed for businesses and adult homeowners, not children.

If we learn we have collected such information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us using the details below.</p>

                            <p>When we process information on behalf of a contractor client, we may need to refer your request to that client, as they are the primary controller of that data.</p>
